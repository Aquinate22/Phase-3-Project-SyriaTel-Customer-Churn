# Recommendation

-Customer care agents could be trained on giving a better customer experience to reduce the churn that increases with customer service calls
-The company can invest more in terms of network and retails outlets on states that have a high churn to mitigate that
-Reward or give discounts to customers with higher total costs to prevent churn


# Conclusion


Customers are important to any business and investing on ways to mitigate churn is crucial. Syrial Tel can employ the recommended steps to mitigate churn which will inturn increase its sales. Customer service is important and can make or break a business. The customers at Syrial Tel could be calling because they already have an issue, whether they churn or not depends mostly on how they were handled. Good customer service means a better resolution and satisfaction and that will prevent a customer from churning. Customers who spend more will feel more appreciated and recognized when they are rewarded.
